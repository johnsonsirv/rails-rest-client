## Interacting with a Rails App with RestClient

In this project, I interact with a `rails` application from the command line by sending `HTTP` requests manually. By building a very simple app and then a simple script which uses the `rest-client` gem, I send some requests and examine the server output.

### Technology:

* Ruby 2.4.0
* Rails MVC (5.2.3)
* RestClient (2.0.2) / HTTP

### How to Run:
* clone the repo 
* start rails server `$ rails server`
* execute the rest client script `$ ruby app/script/rest_ping.rb`
